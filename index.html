 	         <h2>History & Art</h2>
 	            <p>
 		             History is a narrative that corresponds to the addition of multiple facts from the past that are related to the evolution of humanity. However, it is also a set of unsolved mysteries. 
 		             Art is a technique of communication that allows to convey multiple messages and to touch the senses and emotions of a large audience.

            <h2>Climbing</h2>
 	             <p>
 		             Focusing on how to properly place your feet on the holds, turning your hips as you try to reach a hold, using your whole body to find the right positions to reach the goal. This is what climbing is all about.
